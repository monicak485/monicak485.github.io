        <p>Atoms to Astronauts is a free, after-school STEM learning experience for elementary school students. Founded in spring 2017 by two George Washington University 
            engineering students, Atoms to Astronauts has provided fun STEM activities to five different DC public schools and 100 students ranging from second to fourth grade. 
            The mission of Atoms to Astronauts is to introduce the fun and exciting aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to children at a young age through 
            simple lessons. We aim to cover several disciplines within STEM through our activities, which all comprise of a fun, hands-on aspect that introduces the children 
            to a basic practice within the field. Past activities have included creating small towers with marshmallows and popsicle sticks, testing the buoyancy of aluminum 
            foil boats, exploring non-newtonian fluids  through the creation of “oobleck”, and “designing” alien planets after learning about the components of the earth’s 
            ecosystem. <a class = "a-link-unique" href = "/past-projects"> Click here to learn more about our past projects and activities. </a> </p> 	
        <p> Atoms to Astronauts is unique because it is offered at no cost to its recipients. Public schools in the DC area cater to a variety of diverse students that come 
            from all income, race, and family backgrounds. The schools that we have targeted had no pre-existing STEM after-school programs. By providing free activities to all 
            of these students, Atoms to Astronauts targets children that may have no access to the fun side of STEM otherwise. Atoms to Astronauts has experienced great success 
            over the past year; students, teachers, and volunteers have all expressed their satisfaction with our program. Students that have “graduated” to the next grade-level 
            in school have approached our volunteers, asking to return to STEM club. Teachers have continuously asked for us to return to the schools and written letters in 
            support of Atoms to Astronauts. Finally, all of our volunteers provided us with feedback about the great experiences they have had while working with the students 
            over the semester. Overall, Atoms to Astronauts is succeeding in its short-term goals. </p>
        <p> Our long term goals for Atoms to Astronauts include expanding to every DC public school, recruiting volunteers from various universities to travel to the schools, 
            and creating a cohesive learning experience for the children. While the activities we are currently carrying out provide an introduction to STEM, we would like to 
            turn the program into a robotics league. Creating such a league would cost a significant sum of money per school. 
            Atoms to Astronauts has received over $1800 in funding from the HERLead fellowship and grant program. Atoms to Astronauts has also received $2000 in funding from 
            Dean David Dolling of George Washington University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.</p>
